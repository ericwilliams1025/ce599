    "# Session 1: Introduction to Course, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python\n",
    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended to provide students with the basic skills to become independently able to write your own code and to leverage open source libraries in Python, data science, and web mapping to do your own data processing, analysis, and mapping.  It is not a traditional GIS course, and relies heavily on free, open source, software.  Why?  Because the explosion of open source tools in the past decade has made it possible for anyone with a willingnes to put in a modest amount of effort to learn how to leverage these tools and build their own, without depending on expensive commercial software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ove the course of this semester, we plan to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fundamentals of programming and data wrangling with Python\n",
    "* Dava visualizatoin\n",
    "* Applied statistical modeling and interpretation\n",
    "* Identifying and perpetuating intellectually honest analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is structured as a computer lab based course and each session you will follow along with the lecture and generally also do some experimentation with what we are learning that day.  We will use these Jupyter Notebooks to contain lecture notes and code to demonstrate and to experiment with in class and outside of it.  You should install the software used in the course on a computer of your own to be able to work with it outside of the computer lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "We pace the learning by scheduling a series of exercises, with generally a week to complete them.  These exercises are front-loaded in the semester to build up your skills and confidence.  To gain more independent skills and experience in applying these to problems that are of interest to you, we have a semester project assignment. Projects ensure that you learn these skills with enough independence to become self-sufficient and able to continue building your skills on your own. "

    "The course materials are all online in github.  You will generally begin each class by accessing the materials for that day, downloading them to your computer (either the lab computer or your own laptop), and opening the interactive Jupyter notebook that contains the notes and code for the session.  We will try to incorporate some experimentation into the class sessions, so you can get a better grasp of the material by experimenting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data.  The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.  It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline.  We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now.  Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook.  Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.  "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin using a Jupyter Notebook, you need to launch a command prompt (or command shell).  If you don't know what this is, you'll need to get familiar with the command prompt and navigating around on your computer using change directory commands, in order to be able to launch the notebook. In Windows, there are multiple ways to open a command prompt - nicely explained here: http://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a mac, you can launch the terminal app.  Once you have a shell, navigate (change directory) to whatever directory you want to work in. If you haven't learned how to use a command prompt in windows, this is a good reference for the command prompt in Windows: http://dosprompt.info/. On a mac, the syntax is a bit different since it is based on Linux.  Here is a reference for commands on the mac: http://ss64.com/osx/, or a simpler version here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal.html. You'll need to use the command prompt from the beginning, so get comfortable with basic commands this week if you are not already.\n",

    "Python is an interpreted programming language, also referred to as a *high-level language*, or as a scripting language.  What this means is that when you write some commands, or statements that are meaningful in the Python language, the Python 'interpreter' reads the command, figures out what the intended computation is, and then executes it.  This differs from *low-level* languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to compile code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time.  "
